### is a simple OS, built completely from scratch. ###
Here you can see it in its current state of development:

## Renderer ##
In attempt 1 of trying to build the renderer, it went as far as printing characters all over the screen, as you can see in the following picture.

Now in attempt 2, I've managed to get the renderer to print on the whole screen. These are just A's but this will be fixed soon.

Due to changing the rendering algorithm for now, you can see that the display has got these beautiful shapes with all those different colors. Now you can see the possibilities this renderer has.

## Future plans for the project ##
Currently manshOS is just a kernel that prints out text and can compile C Code, but in the near future more updates and functionalities will be added.
